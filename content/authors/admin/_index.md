I am master's student in Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the Colorado School of Mines. While I am fortunate enough to be involved with a diverse set of research projects at Mines, I am most passionate about the physics of complex systems, and dynamical systems theory. Along with the support from my advisors and mentors, my research training is guided by the Quantum Engineering NSF Research Traineeship (QENRT) through the Quantum Engineering Department at Mines.
